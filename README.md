## Repository Structure
- `Project1_ANN_Customer_Churn/` – Predict customer churn for an e-commerce platform using an ANN.  
- Future projects will follow a similar structure with dedicated folders and READMEs explaining objectives, usage, and learning outcomes.

---

## How to Use
- Navigate to a project folder and open the corresponding Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab file.  
- Follow the instructions in each project README for dataset preparation, folder paths, and running the notebooks.  
- Ensure external datasets are not uploaded directly to GitHub; use dataset URLs for reference.

## Strategic and Learning Value
- Gain hands-on experience in building ML and ANN models from scratch.  
- Learn preprocessing, encoding, scaling, model building, and evaluation techniques.  
- Explore business-relevant use cases such as customer churn prediction, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics.  
- Develop an understanding of key ML/ANN concepts, including dense layers, activation functions, regularization, optimization, and evaluation metrics.  

This repository demonstrates a structured approach to learning and applying Machine Learning and ANN techniques for real-world-inspired problems.
