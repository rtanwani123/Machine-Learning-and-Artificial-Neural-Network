# E-Commerce Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

**Objective:** Predict customer churn for an e-commerce platform using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to enable proactive retention strategies.

**Note:** This project uses the open-source Kaggle dataset: [E-Commerce Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction](YOUR_KAGGLE_URL_HERE). **Do not upload the dataset to GitHub**; reference it via the Kaggle URL.

## How to Run in Google Colab
- Important: Before running the notebook, upload the dataset to Google Colab.  
- Ensure the folder path in the code (`/content/ANN/E-Commerce-Dataset.csv`) matches your uploaded file.  
- Copy the Kaggle dataset URL in the comments section for reference and attribution.

## Strategic Approach
- Represent customer behavior and engagement metrics in a numerical format for the ANN.  
- Handle categorical data using encoding and balance the target classes for effective learning.  
- Implement an ANN with fully connected layers, ReLU activation, Dropout regularization, and early stopping for robust prediction.  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and probability-based predictions.

## Learning Value
- Understand the end-to-end workflow from raw tabular data to actionable churn predictions.  
- Learn to preprocess, encode, and scale features for ANN models.  
- Explore concepts like dense layers, activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid), dropout regularization, early stopping, and probability-based classification.  
- Gain hands-on experience with Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, and data visualization techniques.  

This project demonstrates a practical AI framework to predict customer churn and support business strategy decisions in an e-commerce environment.
